# Changelog

All notable changes to Sifty. The format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions before the first
public release were development milestones.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09

### Added

- **Proactive maintenance agent**: `sifty agent run` does a full read-only
  checkup plus anomaly detection and toasts a short summary. Schedule it with
  `sifty agent schedule` to have Sifty keep an eye on things in the background.
- **Anomaly detection**: Sifty now notices change over time - a drive that lost
  a lot of free space, junk piling up fast, or a new program added to Windows
  startup - and surfaces it in the checkup, the Home screen, and the AI's
  context. Baselines are stored locally (sizes and startup names only).
- **Opt-in unattended auto-fix**: with `[agent].auto_fix` turned on, the
  scheduled run may auto-clean a small, fixed allowlist of per-user cache/temp
  junk (never system or admin locations, never your files), all to the Recycle
  Bin and undoable from Reports. Off by default: it only notifies.
- **AI summary on Home**: when the local model is available, the Home checkup
  shows a short plain-language read on what matters most and what to do first.
- **Run agent from Home**: a "Run agent" button runs the whole proactive pass
  and cleans the low-risk allowlist to the Recycle Bin behind a confirm, showing
  the checkup, any anomalies, and what it cleaned right there.
- **VS Code cache cleanup**: the junk cleaner now covers VS Code's `Cache`,
  `CachedData`, `Code Cache`, and `GPUCache` directories, never the `User`
  folder that holds your settings, keybindings, and extensions. Thanks
  @YoMosa2009.
- `sifty doctor` now reports the Python and Windows version it is running on,
  in both the table and the JSON output. Thanks @JMar2021.
- Test coverage for `human_size()` across the unit boundaries. Thanks
  @be-student.

### Changed

- The Home checkup now lists notable changes as their own reviewable rows, each
  linking to the screen where you can act on them.

### Fixed

- **`sifty update check` no longer invents an extra update.** winget prints a
  "N upgrades available." line under its table, and when that line was wider
  than the Name column it was parsed as another app. Rows now have to line up
  with the table's columns. Thanks to @crankycupcake for the report (#37).
- Optional services that aren't installed on the machine are reported as
  absent instead of failing with a misleading "needs administrator rights",
  and they no longer write a traceback to the diagnostics log.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07

### Added

- **The AI remembers your machine.** The chat now persists across restarts,
  and Sifty learns your habits - the categories you routinely clean and the
  actions you tend to decline feed into the AI's context so its advice matches
  how you actually use the tool. Everything stays local: names, sizes and
  counts only, never file contents.
- **Per-tool AI policies**: set any agent tool to `auto` (run without asking),
  `ask` (always confirm), or `never` (block it) with
  `sifty ai policy set <tool> <auto|ask|never>`; `sifty ai policy list` shows
  every tool, its risk, and what will happen. These layer on top of the global
  autonomy level, so you can auto-clean junk but always confirm an uninstall.
- **`sifty ai autonomy`**: show or set the global autonomy level from the CLI
  (previously only the TUI dropdown).

### Changed

- The agent no longer re-runs the same read-only scan twice within a single
  request, so multi-step answers come back faster.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07

### Added

- **Discord cache cleanup**: the junk cleaner now covers Discord's `Cache`,
  `Code Cache`, and `GPUCache` directories - cache only, never tokens or
  message history.
- **Windows installer**: a graphical `sifty-setup.exe` (Inno Setup) with a
  Welcome / License / Install / Finish wizard that adds Sifty to PATH and
  registers an Add/Remove Programs entry, alongside the existing portable exe.

### Changed

- **Item counts read with thousands separators** across the CLI (e.g.
  `12,480 files` instead of `12480`).
- **Worktree cleanup** is now described by what it detects - any prunable git
  worktree, not just coding-agent leftovers - so it also matches CI checkouts
  and abandoned experiments.

### Fixed

- **`sifty tui` no longer crashes in the packaged exe.** Textual imports its
  widgets lazily, so PyInstaller left `textual.widgets._tab_pane` (and the
  `styles.tcss` stylesheet) out of the build and the TUI died on launch. Both
  are now bundled. Affected winget / scoop / installer users only; pip and
  pipx installs were fine.
- **Optimize no longer crashes when you navigate away mid-run.** The
  background worker now no-ops once its view is unmounted instead of raising.
- **Self-update is disabled on editable (`-e`) installs** instead of offering
  a phantom upgrade that then fails and can half-rebuild the venv.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06

### Added

- **Uninstall leftovers scanner**: `sifty apps leftovers "App"` finds the
  directories and Start Menu shortcuts an uninstaller left behind in
  AppData/ProgramData (conservative exact-name matching, never inside
  Windows/Program Files). The CLI reports leftovers automatically after an
  uninstall; the Apps TUI offers to clean them right after a bulk uninstall.
- **`sifty config`**: show / get / set / reset / edit the configuration
  without hunting through `%APPDATA%` (writes only your overrides).
- **Browser cache coverage**: every Chrome/Edge/Brave/Vivaldi profile
  (Cache, Code Cache, GPUCache) plus Firefox `cache2`; cache dirs only,
  never cookies/history/passwords.
- **Crash-report junk categories**: per-user crash dumps + WER queues, and
  system WER/kernel minidumps (admin).
- **`sifty organize undo`**: moves the last organize session's files back
  and removes the emptied folders.

### Changed

- **Home** is now the checkup: findings carry direct fix buttons (clean junk,
  clean stale downloads, apply updates, each behind the usual confirm) and
  the redundant stat-card grid is gone.
- **AI chat approvals are inline**: Run/Skip buttons in the transcript
  instead of a pop-up modal; quick-action buttons removed.
- **Startup screen** matches the Services pattern: highlight a row, then
  Enable/Disable buttons; clicking a row no longer toggles it instantly.
- Bare group commands (`sifty junk`, `sifty disk`, …) print their full help
  instead of a "try --help" hint.

### Fixed

- Junk clean now reports how many items were skipped and why (in use / need
  admin) instead of silently looking like it did nothing on a re-clean.
- Self-update version-check failures are logged instead of swallowed.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06

### Added

- **Checkup**: a read-only full-suite health scan (`sifty checkup` and a
  Home-screen hero button): junk, pending updates, registry orphans, stale
  downloads, low disk space, and startup bloat in one report, each finding
  with a one-tap action.
- **AI follow-up actions**: when an AI tool scan finds something, the result
  card offers a button that jumps to the screen that can act on it.
- **Self-update** (`sifty selfupdate`) via PyPI + pipx.
- **Git worktree cleanup**: detect and prune orphaned git worktrees
  (`Worktrees` mode in Smart cleanup).
- **VHD compaction**: compact WSL2/Hyper-V virtual disks via DISM.
- Installer intelligence: the Downloads-installers junk category only flags
  installers whose app is already installed.

### Changed

- TUI navigation consolidated into tabbed groups: **Clean** (Junk, Purge,
  Optimize, Smart) and **Apps** (Installed, Updates, Startup, Services); every
  former screen stays reachable via the command palette.
- Home redesigned: clickable stat cards, summaries cached between visits,
  compact admin status line.
- Browse… folder picker on the Purge and Smart cleanup screens.

### Fixed

- Worktree pruning honors the row selection and no longer crashes when an
  orphan directory exists on disk.
- Registry orphan scanner filters SystemComponent and winget-managed entries.

## [0.4.0] - 2026

- NTFS-aware duplicate detection (hardlinks counted once), concurrent junk
  scanning and hashing, registry orphan detection (read-only), apps-screen
  orphan panel.

## [0.3.0] - 2026

- Dev artifact purge (`node_modules`, `dist`, `__pycache__`, …), system optimize
  (DNS flush, thumbnail/prefetch/update-cache rebuild, DISM component
  cleanup), five new junk categories.

## [0.2.0] - 2026

- Layered architecture (core / windows / infra / cli / tui), smart cleanup
  (duplicates, large files, stale downloads), startup manager (reversible),
  curated services manager, cleanup profiles + Task Scheduler integration,
  low-disk watch with toast alerts, clean history (SQLite) + undo, `--json`
  scripting output, agentic AI with autonomy levels, live system monitor,
  on-demand UAC elevation, command palette, crash logging.

## [0.1.0] - 2026

- Initial release: junk scan/clean, disk analysis, duplicate finder, app
  list/uninstall (winget), updates via winget, file organization, local-AI
  advisor (Ollama), safety layer (Recycle Bin only, dry-run default,
  protected paths, audit log), Textual TUI.
